    Implies:
    Offset P1 square by [323, 0] to get P2 square
    Offset P1 square by [0, 240] to get P3 square
    Offset P1 square by [323, 240] to get P4 square

    We can check this by creating template masks from each existing character
    mask and then automatically creating character masks for all other squares
    from that.
    
    P1 square width looks to be: about 310 (x) by 236 (y)
    P3 square looks to range from [242, 474] on x-axis and 310 pixels wide

ITEM BOXES

Based on frame 73 of 2013-08-02_0000.mov.

top-left corner of black box in 1st square: 47 x 34
(that's the top-left most pixel that looks blackish -- it's not as black as
other pixels in the center of the box, but it's clearly "in the box" and not
part of the frame.)

same pixel in 2nd square: 542 x 34
x offset: 542 - 47 = 495
same pixel in 3rd square: 47 x 264
y offset: 264 - 34 = 230
