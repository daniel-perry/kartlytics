Current status:
- Add processing time to UI
- Rework screens:
  - Figure out what else to put onto front page.
    slugfest races, billings, photo finishes,
    table of tracks by keithings, slugfests, photo finishes, and so on
  - Add more to the "track details" screen and/or deep link to corresponding
    track on "all tracks" screen
  - Add race and character images where appropriate?
- Manually check the full output on all videos -- see "Known Issues" below.
  Previous problem videos include recording-0003.

Quality of life:
- Write a tool for diffing results between two runs on the same race.

Known issues:
- 2012-06-19-00.mov:
  - No position information until 23s into the race (e.g., what about state at
    10s, change at 12s?)
  - Not handling pause around 15s
  - Missing "Yoshi finishes" at 2:29 and "Toad finishes" at 2:30
2013-08-02_0000.mov:
  - Around 1:21, we miss an item cycle for player 3 because the item box never
    disappears between one cycle and the next.
